## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

1.Introduction

Weather plays a crucial role in our daily lives and influences various aspects such as agriculture, transportation, and lifestyle.
In this project, we analyze weather data (temperature, humidity, and rainfall) for multiple cities. The goal is to clean and transform the dataset, calculate weekly averages, identify weather patterns, and visualize the results for meaningful insights.

By performing this analysis in R, we strengthen our skills in data manipulation, summarization, and visualization using powerful libraries like dplyr, ggplot2, and lubridate.

2.Conclusion

The analysis revealed interesting weather patterns across different cities:

The hottest and coldest cities were identified based on average temperatures.

The day with the highest rainfall for each city was highlighted.

Humidity levels showed notable differences between cities.

Weekly averages helped smooth short-term fluctuations and gave a clearer view of long-term trends.

Through visualization, it became easier to compare trends and distributions across cities.
Overall, this project demonstrates the usefulness of R programming in handling real-world datasets, cleaning missing values, summarizing information, and creating clear visual stories from data.

```{r weather}

weather <- read.csv('weather.csv') #read csv file
head(weather) #print few rows 

colnames((weather)) #print colnames 

sum(is.na(weather)) #check how many null values

weather <- na.omit(weather) #handel null values
print(weather)

selcted_city <- c("Ahmedabad", "Delhi", "Mumbai") #fillter 3 city in dataset
city <- subset(weather, City %in% selcted_city)
print(city)

weather <- city %>% mutate(Temp_F = Temperature * 9/5 + 32) #create new columns temp_f for count temprature
print(weather)

weather$Date <- as.Date(weather$Date) #convet into date fomate


weekly_avg <- weather %>%  #function for count weekaly average
  group_by(City, week = isoweek(Date)) %>%
  summarise(
    Avg_Temp = mean(Temperature, na.rm=TRUE), #na.rm handel null value
    Avg_Humidity = mean(Humidity, na.rm=TRUE),
    Avg_Rainfall = mean(Rainfall, na.rm=TRUE)
  )
print(weekly_avg)

city_avg_temp <- weather %>% #function for count city average temprature
  group_by(City) %>% #group by city 
  summarise(Avg_Temp = mean(Temperature))
city_avg_temp

hottest <- city_avg_temp %>% filter(Avg_Temp == max(Avg_Temp)) #find hotest temprature 
coldest <- city_avg_temp %>% filter(Avg_Temp == min(Avg_Temp)) #find coldest temprature

hottest
coldest
 
max_rain <- weather %>% #function for find maximum rain city
  group_by(City) %>%
  filter(Rainfall == max(Rainfall))
max_rain

city_humidity <- weather %>%  #function for find maximum humidity city
  group_by(City) %>%
  summarise(Avg_Humidity = mean(Humidity))
city_humidity



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r fig.width=10, fig.height=6, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(weather, aes(x = Date, y = Temperature, color = City)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Temperature Trends of Cities Over Time",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Temperature (Â°C)") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +   # larger text
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))

ggplot(weekly_avg, aes(x=factor(week), y=Avg_Rainfall, fill=City)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") +
  labs(title="Weekly Average Rainfall", x="Week", y="Rainfall (mm)")

# Boxplot for humidity distribution
ggplot(weather, aes(x=City, y=Humidity, fill=City)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title="Humidity Distribution Across Cities")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
